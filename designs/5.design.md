# Unified Poster Resizing Command

## Requirements
- Use a single command path `resize_poster_to_fit` across weekly posters and shortCard flows; keep legacy commands but redirect compatibly.
- Plugin `_flushLayoutAsync()` must not call `loadAllFontsAsync`; only `figma.flushAsync` + double `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Anchor resolution order (fallback under poster): `["shortCard","ContentAndPlate","ContentContainer","Odaily固定板","EXIO固定板","干货铺固定板","slot:IMAGE_GRID"]`.
- Weekly script flow unchanged; if any old commands exist, replace with `resize_poster_to_fit`.
- ShortCard script: For each card, call `resize_poster_to_fit({ posterId, anchorId: cardId, bottomPadding: 150 })` with flush before/after. Root frame is the export target and is renamed `短图-${lang}-${index}`.

## Notes / Open Questions
- Keep `slot:IMAGE_GRID` as the last anchor fallback for shortCard under poster? (Set to last.)
- Any stricter `maxHeight` needed beyond 1,000,000?
- Text source alignment is set via container axis MIN and HUG/HUG; explicit text alignment left is not exposed by current commands—confirm if needed.
